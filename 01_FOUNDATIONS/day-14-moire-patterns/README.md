# Day 14 – Moiré Patterns

This sketch generates moiré patterns by overlapping two sets of parallel
lines with a slight rotational offset.

Although each individual grid is simple and regular, their interference
creates large-scale wave-like patterns and visual illusions.

## Concept

Moiré patterns emerge when repetitive structures overlap with small
variations in alignment, spacing, or rotation. Complex visual effects
arise from simple geometric rules.
