# 🌀 Animated Moiré Patterns – Creative Coding Project

This project explores **Moiré interference patterns** using **HTML Canvas and JavaScript**.  
By overlaying two repeating line grids and animating them with slight rotation and offset,
it produces striking visual effects where simple patterns combine into complex waves.

The canvas fills the entire screen, while a floating control panel lets you interact with
the system in real time.

## ✨ Features

- Full-screen animated canvas  
- Two overlapping line fields  
- Smooth rotation and offset animation  
- Real-time Moiré interference effects  
- Density slider to control line spacing  
- “New Pattern” button for random variations  
- Single-file project (HTML + JS + inline CSS)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- How overlapping repeating patterns create Moiré effects  
- Canvas transformations (`translate`, `rotate`, `save`, `restore`)  
- Animation with `requestAnimationFrame`  
- Generative visuals from simple geometric rules  
- Visual amplification: small changes → large effects  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the folder `day-14-moire-patterns/`  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Use the **Density** slider to change line spacing  
4. Click **New Pattern** to randomize the animation  

No setup or dependencies required.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helps you understand:

- Why Moiré patterns appear in real life (screens, prints, fabrics)  
- How small angular differences create dramatic visual interference  
- How to build generative art using Canvas  
- How animation can turn static geometry into living visuals  

It’s ideal for:

- Creative coding practice  
- Visual experiments  
- Interactive backgrounds  
- Showcasing generative art in a portfolio
