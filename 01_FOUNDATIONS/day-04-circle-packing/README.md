# Day 04 – Circle Packing

This sketch explores circle packing, a generative technique where
circles are placed on a canvas without overlapping.

Each circle starts small and grows until it touches another circle
or the edge of the canvas. Repeating this process results in a dense,
organic packing pattern.

## Concept
Circle packing demonstrates how spatial constraints and simple
collision rules can generate complex visual structures.

## Techniques Used
- Distance-based collision detection
- Iterative growth
- Constraint handling
- HTML Canvas API
