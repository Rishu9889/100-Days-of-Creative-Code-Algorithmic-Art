# Day 05 – Recursive Tree

This sketch demonstrates recursion by generating a tree-like structure.

Each branch draws itself and then recursively creates two smaller
branches at different angles. The recursion stops when the branch
length becomes small enough, forming a natural tree shape.

## Concept
Recursive trees show how complex structures can emerge from a
simple rule that repeatedly calls itself.

## Techniques Used
- Recursion with a base case
- Trigonometric calculations (sin, cos)
- Angle-based branching
- HTML Canvas API
