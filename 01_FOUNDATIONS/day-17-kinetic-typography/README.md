# Day 17 – Kinetic Typography

This sketch explores kinetic typography by animating individual
characters of a text string using time-based mathematical motion.

Each letter is treated as an independent visual element and is animated
using a sine wave, creating a flowing, wave-like motion while preserving
readability.

## Concept

Kinetic typography combines text and motion to enhance expression and
meaning. By applying simple mathematical functions over time, subtle and
intentional movement can be created.

## Techniques Used

- Time-based animation
- Trigonometric motion (sine waves)
- Per-character text rendering
- requestAnimationFrame
- HTML Canvas API
