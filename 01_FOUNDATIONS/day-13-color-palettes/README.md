# Day 13 – Color Palettes

This sketch explores the role of color palettes in generative art.

A set of curated color palettes is defined as data. On each run, a
palette is randomly selected and visualized as vertical color bands
across the canvas, highlighting harmony and contrast between colors.

## Concept

In generative systems, structure defines form, but color defines mood.
By constraining randomness to carefully chosen palettes, visually
coherent results can be achieved.

## Techniques Used

- Data-driven color palettes
- Random selection within constraints
- Full-canvas color composition
- HTML Canvas API
