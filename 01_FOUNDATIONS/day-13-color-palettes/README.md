# 🎨 Advanced Color Palette Generator

This project is an interactive **Color Palette Generator** built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps designers and developers create beautiful color combinations using different
color harmony rules such as *Monochromatic, Complementary, Analogous, Triadic,* and *Tetradic* schemes.

The UI is modern and responsive, featuring animated color blocks, sliders for fine-tuning,
copy-to-clipboard support, and palette export.
