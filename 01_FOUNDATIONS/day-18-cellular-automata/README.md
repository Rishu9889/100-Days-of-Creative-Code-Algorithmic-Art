# Day 18 – Cellular Automata

This sketch implements a basic cellular automaton using Conway’s
Game of Life.

The world is represented as a grid of cells, where each cell’s state
is determined by the states of its neighbors. Simple local rules give
rise to complex global behavior over time.

## Concept

Cellular automata demonstrate how complex systems can emerge from
simple rules applied repeatedly across space and time.

## Techniques Used

- Grid-based simulation
- Conway’s Game of Life rules
- Neighbor counting
- Time-based evolution
- HTML Canvas API
