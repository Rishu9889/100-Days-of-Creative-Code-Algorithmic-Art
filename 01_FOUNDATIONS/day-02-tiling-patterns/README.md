# Day 02 – Tiling Patterns

This sketch explores tiling patterns using a simple grid system.

The canvas is divided into equally sized square tiles. In each tile,
a diagonal line is drawn in one of two possible directions, chosen
randomly. Repeating this rule across the grid creates a structured
yet varied pattern.

## Concept
Tiling patterns demonstrate how repetition and simple rules can
generate visually interesting designs without complex math.

## Techniques Used
- Nested loops
- Grid-based layout
- Random choice per tile
- HTML Canvas API
