# Day 07 – Flow Fields

This sketch explores flow fields, where particles move according to
direction vectors generated from smooth noise.

A grid of angles is created using a noise-based function, forming a
vector field. Particles sample the field and adjust their velocity to
follow its direction, resulting in organic, flowing motion.

## Concept
Flow fields demonstrate how simple vector rules can generate complex
motion patterns similar to wind, water, or magnetic forces.

## Techniques Used
- Vector fields
- Noise-based angle generation
- Particle motion and velocity
- requestAnimationFrame animation loop
