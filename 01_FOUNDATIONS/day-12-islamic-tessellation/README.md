# Day 12 – Islamic Tessellation

This sketch generates a geometric tessellation inspired by traditional
Islamic art patterns.

An eight-point star is constructed by overlapping two identical squares,
one aligned with the axes and the other rotated by 45 degrees. This star
unit is then repeated across the canvas to form a seamless tessellation
based on symmetry and repetition.

## Concept

Islamic tessellations rely on mathematical precision, rotational
symmetry, and infinite repetition. Complex patterns emerge from simple
geometric constructions without the use of figurative imagery.

## Techniques Used

- Geometric construction
- Rotational symmetry
- Pattern repetition (tiling)
- HTML Canvas API
