# Day 20 – Mandelbrot Set

This sketch renders the Mandelbrot set using pixel-based iteration on
the complex plane.

Each pixel is mapped to a complex number and iterated using the
Mandelbrot equation. The number of iterations required for divergence
determines the pixel’s color, revealing the fractal’s intricate
boundary structure.

## Concept

The Mandelbrot set demonstrates how infinite complexity can arise from
a simple mathematical rule applied repeatedly.

## Techniques Used

- Complex number iteration
- Escape-time algorithm
- Pixel-level rendering
- Color mapping based on iteration count
- HTML Canvas API
