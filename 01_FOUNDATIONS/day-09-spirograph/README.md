# Day 09 – Spirograph

This sketch visualizes a spirograph pattern using parametric equations.

A spirograph is formed by tracing a point attached to a circle rolling
inside another circle. By varying the radii of the circles and the
distance of the drawing point, intricate looping and symmetrical
patterns emerge.

## Concept
Spirographs demonstrate how parametric equations and rotational motion
can generate complex geometric designs from simple mathematical rules.

## Techniques Used
- Parametric equations
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos)
- Angle-based iteration
