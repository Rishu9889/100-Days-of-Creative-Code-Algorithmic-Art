# Day 15 – Fractal Snowflakes

This sketch generates a fractal snowflake using the Koch curve.

The Koch curve is a recursive fractal where each line segment is
replaced by four smaller segments, forming a triangular protrusion.
By applying this process recursively to the sides of an equilateral
triangle, a Koch snowflake is created.

## Concept

Fractals demonstrate self-similarity, where the same pattern appears
at different scales. The Koch snowflake is a classic example showing
how infinite detail can emerge from a simple recursive rule.
