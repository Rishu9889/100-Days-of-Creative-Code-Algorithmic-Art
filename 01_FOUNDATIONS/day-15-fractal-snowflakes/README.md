# ❄️ Fractal Snowflakes – Creative Coding Project

This project is a creative coding experiment built using **HTML Canvas and JavaScript**.  
It generates beautiful **fractal-style snowflakes** using **recursion and symmetry**.

Each snowflake is drawn by a recursive algorithm that builds branching patterns, and the
entire shape is rotated to form a snowflake. The center snowflake gently rotates.

This visually demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.

## ✨ Features

- Fractal snowflake generation using recursion  
- 6-way radial symmetry like real snowflakes  
- Smooth rotation animation  
- Interactive depth control for complexity  
- Single-file project (HTML + JS + inline CSS)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Recursion in a visual form  
- Canvas transformations (`translate`, `rotate`, `save`, `restore`)  
- Generative art  
- Animation using `requestAnimationFrame`  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the folder `day-15-fractal-snowflakes/`
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Use the **Depth** slider to control complexity  
4. Click **Generate** to drop the current snowflake and create a new one

No setup or dependencies required.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helps understand:

- How recursion builds complex structures  
- How symmetry is created using rotation  
- How canvas-based animations work  
- How code can be used as a medium for art  

It’s a great example of **creative coding** and can be used as:

- A portfolio visual project  
- A learning demo for recursion  
- An interactive background for websites  
- A generative art experiment
