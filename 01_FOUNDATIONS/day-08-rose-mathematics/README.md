# Day 08 – Rose Mathematics

This sketch visualizes a mathematical rose curve using polar coordinates.

The rose curve is defined by the equation:

r = a · cos(kθ)

By iterating over angles and converting polar coordinates into Cartesian
coordinates, a flower-like pattern with symmetrical petals is produced.

To enhance visual depth, multiple scaled layers of the same rose curve
are drawn with varying opacity, giving the appearance of a fuller rose.

## Concept
Rose curves demonstrate how simple trigonometric equations can generate
complex and visually pleasing shapes. The parameter `k` controls the
number of petals, while `a` controls the size of the curve.

## Techniques Used
- Polar coordinates
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos)
- Layered rendering for visual depth
- HTML Canvas API
