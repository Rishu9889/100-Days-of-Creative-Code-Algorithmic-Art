# Day 23 – Pendulum Simulation

This sketch simulates a simple pendulum using angular motion equations.

Instead of linear position and velocity, the system uses angle, angular
velocity, and angular acceleration. Gravity acts as a restoring force,
causing oscillatory motion around the equilibrium point.

## Concept

Pendulum motion is an example of rotational dynamics. Small angular
displacements lead to periodic motion governed by trigonometric
relationships and gravitational acceleration.

## Techniques Used

- Angular motion (θ, ω, α)
- Trigonometric position calculation
- Damping for energy loss
- Time-based animation
- HTML Canvas API
