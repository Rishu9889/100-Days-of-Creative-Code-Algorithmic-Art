# 🎥 Day 70 – Motion Tracking (Frame Differencing)

This project is an **interactive motion tracking application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas)**.  
It uses your webcam to detect motion in real-time and visualizes it with **colorful highlights and trail effects**. Users can also adjust the sensitivity of motion detection and monitor the application's performance with an FPS display.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time motion detection using **frame differencing**  
- **Interactive sensitivity control** (slider) to adjust motion threshold  
- **Colorful motion visualization** for clear feedback  
- **Trail effect** to track motion paths over time  
- FPS display for performance monitoring  
- Responsive canvas that adapts to screen size  
- Works with any modern webcam-enabled browser

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Frame differencing** for motion detection  
- **Pixel-level image processing** in Canvas  
- **Real-time animation** using `requestAnimationFrame`  
- Interactive **user controls** (sliders)  
- **Performance monitoring** (FPS calculation)  
- Creative visualization of computer vision concepts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place the files in a folder (e.g., `day-70-motion-tracking/`)  
2. Ensure you have:
    - index.html
    - sketch.js
3. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
4. Allow access to your webcam when prompted  
5. Move in front of the camera to see motion highlighted on the screen  
6. Adjust the sensitivity slider to fine-tune motion detection  
7. Observe colorful trails and FPS for real-time feedback

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By experimenting with this project, you will learn:

- How **motion detection** can be implemented using simple frame differencing  
- How to process and manipulate **pixel data** in real-time  
- How to create **interactive visualizations** with Canvas  
- How to optimize animations and provide **user feedback**  
- Fundamentals of **creative coding for computer vision**  

This project is perfect for understanding **motion tracking**, **interactive creative coding**, and **real-time visualization** techniques.
