# 🖼️ Virtual Art Gallery – Day 100

A visually immersive **Virtual Art Gallery** built using **HTML, inline CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates a real-world digital exhibition where users can scroll through an **endless collection of artworks**, just like walking through a modern art museum.

The gallery uses **infinite scrolling** to dynamically load new artworks and provides smooth hover effects, lighting, and depth to create an authentic gallery experience.
