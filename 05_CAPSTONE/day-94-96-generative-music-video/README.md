# Generative Music Video (Days 94–96)

A real-time, audio-reactive visual composition built using Three.js and
the Web Audio API.

## Concept
Sound energy directly drives visual transformations. Scale, rotation,
color, and camera movement respond to live audio input, creating a
dynamic generative music video.

## Structure
- Central geometric form acts as visual anchor
- Frequency energy modulates motion and color
- Smooth transitions maintain cinematic flow

## Techniques Used
- Three.js
- Web Audio API (AnalyserNode)
- Audio-driven animation
- Procedural motion and color
