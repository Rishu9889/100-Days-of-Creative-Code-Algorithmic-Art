# GitHub Coral Reef (Days 91–93)

A capstone generative visualization that represents open-source
communities as a living coral reef ecosystem.

## Day 91 – Structure
Recursive branching generates organic coral formations, symbolizing
repository growth and code evolution.

## Day 92 – Motion & Life
Gentle sway and drifting particles introduce underwater motion,
representing contributors and ongoing activity.

## Day 93 – Meaning Layer
Color, scale, and density reflect simulated repository activity,
illustrating how collaborative energy shapes ecosystems.

## Techniques Used
- Three.js
- Recursive geometry
- Procedural motion
- Depth fog and lighting
- Concept-driven generative design
