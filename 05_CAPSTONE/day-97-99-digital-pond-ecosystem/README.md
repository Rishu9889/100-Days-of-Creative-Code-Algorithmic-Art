# Digital Pond Ecosystem (Days 97–99)

A calm, generative ecosystem simulating a digital pond.

## Day 97 – Water
A deformable water surface reacts to disturbances with ripples.

## Day 98 – Fish
Autonomous fish agents swim using simple steering behaviors.

## Day 99 – Life & Interaction
Lilypads drift on the surface and user interaction introduces ripples,
creating a tranquil, living environment.

## Techniques Used
- Three.js
- Vertex displacement
- Agent-based motion
- Procedural interaction
