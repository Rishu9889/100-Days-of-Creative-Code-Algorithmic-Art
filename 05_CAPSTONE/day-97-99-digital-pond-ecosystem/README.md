# 🌊 Day 97–99 – Digital Pond Ecosystem

A stunning **creative-coding simulation** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas)** that brings a living digital pond to life.  
The ecosystem features swimming fish, gently swaying plants, water ripples, and interactive elements that respond to user actions in real time.

This project demonstrates how simple rules and physics can create an engaging, natural-looking environment.

## ✨ Features

- 🐟 **Autonomous Fish**  
  Fish swim smoothly around the pond with natural motion and respond to food dropped by the user.

- 🌱 **Living Plants**  
  Aquatic plants gently sway, simulating underwater currents.

- 💧 **Water Ripples**  
  Clicking anywhere creates expanding ripples, mimicking water disturbance.

- 🍞 **Interactive Feeding**  
  Click on the pond to drop food. Nearby fish are attracted and swim toward it.

- 🎨 **Beautiful Pond Environment**  
  Gradient water depth, soft colors, and fluid animation create a calming visual experience.

- 📱 **Responsive Canvas**  
  The pond automatically adapts to different screen sizes.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Canvas-based animation with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Particle-style systems (ripples, food)
- Autonomous agents (fish behavior)
- Simple physics & vector motion
- Generative and creative coding techniques
- Real-time user interaction

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Create a folder named:
 - day-97-99-digital-pond-ecosystem/

2. Add the following files:
 - index.html
 - sketch.js

3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

4. Interact with the pond:
- **Click anywhere** → Create ripples & drop food  
- **Add Fish** → Spawn a new fish  
- **Add Plant** → Grow a new plant

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By exploring this project, you will learn:

- How to simulate natural systems using simple rules  
- How motion, interaction, and visuals combine to form a “living” environment  
- How to build immersive experiences with only Canvas and JavaScript  
- The basics of agent behavior and ecosystem-style simulations  

This project is perfect for showcasing **creative coding**, **generative art**, and **interactive simulations** in your portfolio.
