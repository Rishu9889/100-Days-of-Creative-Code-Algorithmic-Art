# 🌌 Day 21 – Gravity & Bounce

This is a **creative-coding physics project** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas)**.  
It demonstrates **basic physics concepts** such as **position, velocity, acceleration, gravity, and collisions** in an interactive, visual way.

Users can observe balls falling under gravity, bouncing off the floor and walls, and interact by adding new balls with a click. Hovering over a ball shows its current physics state in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- Multiple balls with random sizes and colors  
- Gravity simulation with realistic bouncing and energy loss  
- Ball-wall collisions  
- Click anywhere to spawn new balls  
- Hover over a ball to view:
  - Position `(x, y)`  
  - Velocity `(vx, vy)`  
  - Acceleration `(ax, ay)`  
- Smooth, animated motion using `requestAnimationFrame`  
- Responsive canvas that adapts to window size  
- Fading background trail for a smooth motion effect

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Newtonian physics**: F = m * a  
- Position, velocity, and acceleration integration  
- Simple collision detection with walls and floor  
- Visualizing physics state for educational purposes  
- Using HTML Canvas for interactive animations  
- Event handling for user interactions (click & mousemove)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place the files in a folder (e.g., `day-21-gravity-bounce/`)  
2. Ensure you have:
    - index.html
    - sketch.js
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
4. Observe balls falling under gravity  
5. Hover over any ball to view its physics state  
6. Click anywhere to spawn a new ball  

No additional dependencies required.
