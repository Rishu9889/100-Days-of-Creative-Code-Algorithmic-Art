# Day 21 – Gravity & Bounce

This sketch introduces basic physics simulation using position,
velocity, and acceleration.

A constant gravitational force accelerates a ball downward. When the
ball collides with the floor, it bounces with slight energy loss,
demonstrating how forces accumulate to produce motion.

## Concept

Motion is the result of forces acting over time. By explicitly modeling
forces, velocity, and acceleration, complex physical behavior can be
built from simple rules.

## Techniques Used

- Newtonian motion
- Gravity as a constant force
- Velocity integration
- Boundary collision handling
- HTML Canvas API
