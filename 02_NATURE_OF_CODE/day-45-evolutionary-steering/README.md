# Day 45 – Evolutionary Steering

This sketch demonstrates evolutionary steering behaviors using a simple
genetic algorithm.

A population of agents attempts to reach a target while avoiding an
obstacle. Each agent’s movement is controlled by a DNA sequence of force
vectors. Over generations, successful behaviors are selected and
mutated, leading to improved navigation.

## Concept

Evolutionary algorithms optimize behavior through selection, crossover,
and mutation. When combined with steering forces, agents can evolve
solutions to complex navigation problems without explicit programming.
