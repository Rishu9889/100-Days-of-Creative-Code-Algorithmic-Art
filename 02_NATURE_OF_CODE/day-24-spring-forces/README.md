# Day 24 – Spring Forces

This sketch simulates a mass attached to a fixed anchor by a spring.

The system uses Hooke’s Law to compute the restoring force based on how
much the spring is stretched or compressed. Gravity pulls the mass
downward, while damping removes energy to prevent infinite oscillation.

## Concept

Spring systems demonstrate how constraints and restoring forces produce
oscillatory motion. These principles are foundational for soft-body
physics, cloth simulation, and structural dynamics.
