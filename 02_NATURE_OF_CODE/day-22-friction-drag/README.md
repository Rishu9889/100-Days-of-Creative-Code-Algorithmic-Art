# Day 22 – Friction & Drag

This sketch extends basic motion simulation by introducing resistive
forces: friction and drag.

Drag acts continuously opposite to velocity and increases with speed,
while friction acts when the object contacts the surface, reducing
horizontal motion. Together, these forces remove energy from the system
and create more realistic motion.

## Concept

Not all forces add energy. Friction and drag dissipate energy, slowing
objects over time. Modeling these forces is essential for realistic
physical simulations.

## Techniques Used

- Newtonian motion
- Drag force proportional to speed²
- Friction force opposite to motion
- Force accumulation
