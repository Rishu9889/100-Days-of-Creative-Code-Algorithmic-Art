# Day 25 – Particle Fire

This sketch simulates a fire-like particle system using simple
physics-based particles.

Particles are emitted from a source, rise upward due to initial velocity,
and are affected by gravity and drag. Each particle has a finite
lifespan and fades out over time, creating the visual impression of
flames.

## Concept

Particle systems model complex phenomena by combining many simple agents
with limited lifetimes. Fire, smoke, and explosions can all be simulated
using this approach.

## Techniques Used

- Particle systems
- Lifespan-based fading
- Force accumulation
- Gravity and drag
- Alpha blending
- HTML Canvas API
