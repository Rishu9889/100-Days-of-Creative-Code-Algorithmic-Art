# Day 50 – Sandpile Physics

This sketch implements the Abelian sandpile model, a classic example of
self-organized criticality.

Grains of sand are repeatedly added to a grid. When a cell exceeds a
threshold, it topples and distributes grains to its neighbors. Over
time, complex, fractal-like patterns emerge without randomness.

## Concept

Sandpile models demonstrate how simple local rules can lead to
large-scale structure and critical behavior. They are widely studied in
statistical physics and complexity science.

## Techniques Used

- Cellular automaton
- Threshold-based toppling
- Emergent pattern formation
- Pixel-level rendering
- HTML Canvas API
