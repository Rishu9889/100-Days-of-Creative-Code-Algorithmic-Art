# 🕰️ Pendulum Simulation

A simple, physics-based **pendulum simulation** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project visualizes the motion of a simple pendulum using real equations of motion.

No libraries. No frameworks. Just math and canvas.

## 🎯 Features

- Realistic pendulum motion
- Gravity-based angular acceleration
- Damping to simulate energy loss
- Smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Reset functionality

---

## 🧠 Physics Behind the Simulation

The motion is based on the **simple pendulum equation**:

θ'' = −(g / L) · sin(θ)

Where:
- θ is the angular displacement
- g is gravitational acceleration
- L is the length of the pendulum

The simulation numerically integrates this equation frame-by-frame.
