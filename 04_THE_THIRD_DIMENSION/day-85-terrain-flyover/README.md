# Day 85 – Terrain Flyover

This sketch renders a procedural terrain using vertex displacement and
presents it through a smooth, cinematic camera flyover.

## Concept
A heightmap is generated algorithmically and applied directly to a plane
geometry. Lighting and fog enhance depth perception, while a continuous
camera motion creates the sensation of flying over a landscape.

## Techniques Used
- Three.js
- Vertex displacement
- Procedural height generation
- Fog for depth
- Animated camera flyover
