# Day 80 – Procedural City

This sketch generates a simple procedural city using Three.js.

Buildings are arranged on a grid, with each block’s height and color
determined algorithmically. Despite the simplicity of the rules, the
resulting structure resembles an abstract urban skyline.

## Concept

Procedural cities are built by combining repetition with controlled
random variation. By extruding basic shapes and applying constraints,
complex environments can emerge from simple rules.

## Techniques Used

- Three.js
- Grid-based procedural generation
- Randomized parameters with bounds
- Perspective camera and lighting
