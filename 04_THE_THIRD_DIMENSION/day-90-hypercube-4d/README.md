# Day 90 – Hypercube (4D)

This sketch visualizes a 4D hypercube (tesseract) by projecting it into
3D space and rendering its edges.

## Concept
A hypercube exists in four spatial dimensions. By rotating it in 4D and
projecting it into 3D, we can visualize higher-dimensional structure as
a dynamic geometric form.

## Techniques Used
- Four-dimensional geometry
- 4D rotation
- Perspective projection (4D → 3D)
- Three.js line rendering
