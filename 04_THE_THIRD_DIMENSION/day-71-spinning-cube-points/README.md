# Day 71 – Spinning Cube (Points)

This sketch introduces 3D rendering using Three.js.

A cube is rendered as a set of points rather than solid faces, allowing
the structure and rotation of the object to be clearly observed. The
scene uses a perspective camera and basic rotation to demonstrate 3D
space and projection.

## Concept

Three-dimensional scenes are constructed using a scene graph, camera,
and renderer. By rotating objects in 3D space and projecting them onto a
2D screen, depth and perspective are perceived.

## Techniques Used

- Three.js
- Perspective camera
- Point-based geometry
- 3D rotation
- WebGL rendering
